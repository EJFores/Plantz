# Plantz
Plantz - The App designed to help you find the ideal environment for you plant.

This App was made for a College Level Android Development Course at Southern Illinois University (IST 422-723). Its purpose was to 
create an app for public purposes. It collects local data based on your phones location and climate and uses the collected
information and API's to determine if certain plants are optimal for the given conditions. 

This idea and the code is the property of Ethan Flores, Manny Tapia, Nicholas Pilkington, and Greg Evans. Any use of the code 
within this project without express permision of the creators will be met with mild hostility in real life and extreme violence
in Battlefield 1. 

Enjoy!
